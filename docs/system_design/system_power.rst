System Power 
++++++++++++

The following elements need to be powered:

    #.  Antennas

        #. Voltage: +9 V and -9 V 
        #.  Power:  13 mA average, 20 mA peak per antenna. Clarify with John if this is 20 mA for each power rail or total.
    #. Digital board
    
        #. ADC:
            #. +5 V 
            #. + 1.8 V for the analog section.
            #. + 1.8 V for the digital section.
        #. FPGA:
            #. 3.3 V is used by the FPGA and the flash memory that carries the FPGA code.
            #. 1.8 V for IO connection to ADC
            #. 1.2 V locally generated from 1.8 on iCEBreaker board. Maybe DCDC?



Suggested Power System 
----------------------

Main power is provided by a 6 cell Lithium Polymer battery with a nominal voltage of 22.2 V. It needs to be checked if a 5 cell is a better alternative. The 6 cell may be generated by smaller units like 2x 3-cell as 6 cell LiPos tend to be very large and heavy.

    #. Maximum voltage: 25.2 V 
    #. Minimum voltage: 18 V 

Use buck DCDC converters to generate:

    #. 5 V analog. DCDC to 5.5 V filtered and followed by LDO.
    #. 1.8 V analog. DCDC to 2.5 V filtered and followed by LDO.
    #. 1.2 V digital DCDC filtered.
    #. 3.3 V digital, DCDC filtered.
